Heat-seekers
============

This was a very short experiment to explore coding a single game element I had never played with before, namely heat seeking missiles.  Was created over the course of a few hours, with the goal of making 2D missiles that felt fun and slightly erratic, similar to what you get in TV and movies.

To run, simply open the index.html in the bin folder.

Coded in AS3 using the [FlashPunk library](https://github.com/Rolpege/FlashPunk).
